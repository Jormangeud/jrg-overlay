squishyball is a simple command-line utility for performing
double-blind A/B, A/B/X or X/X/Y (A/B/X with additional sample order
randomisation) testing of audio samples on the command line.

The user specifies two input files to be compared and uses the
keyboard during playback to flip between the randomized samples to
perform on-the-fly comparisons.  After a predetermined number of
trials, squishyball prints the trial results to stdout and exits.

squishyball can be used to help establish what lossy audio codec
settings are optimal for a particular combination of user and
audio equipment.
